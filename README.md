Spinning Donut that took 5 hour of my life.

I got the idea of this by watching this ASMR video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj7DOPPTkQA) althought his donut was way better than mine. I then found this article (https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) in the description and found it kinda interesting then afterwards i found that this code also existed (https://www.dropbox.com/s/79ga2m7p2bnj1ga/donut_deobfuscated.c?dl=0) so I made this. Took me about 5 hours but my friend said it was worth it. :)

Big thanks to this guy, I took a lot of inspiration from his code (https://github.com/codegiovanni/Donut_2.0) like the perfect window size.

Future plans:

FPS bar (just like his donut) to make it look clean. ‚òëÔ∏è

A rgb donut because it's just white. ‚ùå

Adding a feature to control the donut's movement.‚ùå

My motivation now - üìâ
